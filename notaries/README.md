# Overview
Notaries are selected to act as [fiduciaries](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fiduciary) for the Filecoin network. Notaries are entrusted to uphold the [Principles]() of the program - responsibly allocating DataCap to help foster legitimate use cases on Filecoin. This document aims to provide additional specificity to the role/responsibility of Notaries, define the application and selection process, and the process for making changes. 

## Roles & Responsibilities
The base responsibilities of the Notaries are as follows: 
- Allocate DataCap to clients in order to subsidize reliable and useful storage on the network.
- Verify that clients receive a DataCap commensurate with the level of trust that is warranted based on information provided. 
- Ensure that in the allocation of the DataCap no party is given excessive trust in any form that might jeopardize the network.
- Follow operational guidelines, keep record of decision flow, and respond to any requests for audits of their allocation decisions.

**Note:** Notaries are given autonomy in their decision making process and encouraged to allocate DataCap based on their best judgement. However, Notaries should expect to answer any questions about previous allocation decisions before receiving future DataCap to distribute. Guidelines for reasonable allocation strategies are supplied in this repository (both a [recommended scoring mechanism for prospective Clients](), as well as a [sample set of questions to ask of Clients]()). While not mandatory to use, these documents represent the expected baseline for well-behaved Notaries.

## Restrictions
As stated above, Notaries are given a high degree of autonomy in their decision making power. To start, we aim to have a minimal set of constraints to ensure this mechanism is used fairly. This list may be expanded or removed entirely as this Mechanism stabalizes. 

* **No self dealing**: To prevent conflicts of interest, Notaries should not allocate DataCap to clients over which they control the private keys. In the event this is an issue, the Notary should contact another Notary (in the same geography or aligned to the same use case) to handle the allocation for that specific client. 

## Application / Selection Process
For those interested in providing this service to the Filecoin network, they may apply to this role by filing an Issue [here]().

Please note, applications are reviewed on a ***regular cadence (tbd)*** basis - and will be graded according to this community defined [criteria](). Edits to the criteria, will follow the same process as any proposed change to this repository, defined [here](/README.md#process-for-modifications). 

## Removal Process
Notaries that have consistent and substantive issues raised against them and have been found to be legitimately abusing their power will be made ineligible for DataCap allocations. The process for raising and resolving disputes can be found [here]().
